    <span id="intro"> Welcome hockey newbies!! <br> <br>
          I hope to walk you through the all the basics and some <br> of the more complex parts of field
          hockey so you can <br> go out into the world and play this beautiful game!</span>

    <div id="pos">
      <h2 id ="posTitle">Positions</h2>
      <div id="pos-text">
        <p>These are the different roles a player might have on the pitch and also
              the corresponding area on the pitch that they might therefore occupy in
              order to perform their role effectively. Hence it relates to their physical
              position on the pitch.</p>

            <h3>Defence</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Usually 2-4 players + a goalie</li>
                  <li>Duty is to prevent the ball going in to the goal they are defending</li>
                  <li> Will be the ones to take "16s" which is when the ball is taken from the top of the D after the attacking team hits it off the backline</li>
                  <li>4 defenders will stand in the goal in a short corner (which I will explain more about later)</li>

            <h3>Midfield</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>As the name suggests these players stand in the middle of the pitch</li>
              <li>Is the posittion that requires the most running</li>
              <li>Role  is to transfer the ball up the pitch towards the goal we want to score into (from the defenders to the attackers)</li>
              <li>Their central position means they are in an ideal position to support both attackers and defender when required</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Role is to score goals</li>
              <li>Player must be physically within the D in order to be able to score a goal</li>

    <div id="goalie">
    <h3 id="goalieTitle">Goalie</h3>
        <p>Although goalkeepers are technically part of the defence I thought it would be
           more appropriate to give them their own seperate category given that the way
           they play so diffferent to the other players and different rules apply to them.
           <br> <br>
           Right off the bat, the most noticable difference between the goalie and any other
           player is the amount of kit they wear. Given that most of the time they're standing
           in the middle of a goal getting rock hard hockey balls pelted at them, it makes sense
           that they should wear more kit. This includes Helmet, Kickers, Leg guards, Chest pads,
           Pelvic/Groin guard, Board Shorts, Throat Guard, Arm Guards, Hand Protectors (plus a smock to put over it all).
           As I said it's a lot of extra kit. And as a goalie, they're allowed to kick the ball as
            well as bat it away with pretty much any part of their body (usually hands leg or stick though).
            As you are likely to know from any other sport that involves a goalkeeper, the primary
            responsibility of this pplayer is to prevent goals being scored against them ie, don't
            let any balls enter the goal they are protecting.
            <br> <br>
          Note: picture displayer on to the right is of Amy Tennant a current goalkeeper for England
          women's hockey team.
