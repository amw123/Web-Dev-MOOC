    <h1>An Introduction to Hockey</h1>

    <span> Welcome hockey newbies!! <br> <br>
          I hope to walk you through the all the basics and some <br> of the more complex parts of field
          hockey so you can <br> go out into the world and play this beautiful game!</span>

    <div id="pos">
      <h2>POSITIONS</h2>
      <div id="pos-text">
        <p>These are the different roles a player might have on the pitch and also
              the corresponding area on the pitch that they might therefore occupy in
              order to perform their role effectively. Hence it relates to their physical
              position on the pitch. The 3 types of position</p>

          <div class="column" style="background-color:#0b005c;">
            <h3>Defence</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Usually 2-4 players + a goalie</li>
                  <li>Duty is to prevent the ball going in to the goal they are defending</li>
                  <li> Will be the ones to tak "16s" which is when the ball is taken from the top of the D after the attacking team hits it off the backline</li>
                  <li>4 defenders will stand in the goal in a short corner (which I will explain more about later)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="column" style="background-color:#000000;">
            <h3>Midfield</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>As the name suggests these players stand in the middle of the pitch</li>
              <li>Is the posittion that requires the most running</li>
              <li>Role  is to transfer the ball up the pitch towards the goal we want to score into (from the defenders to the attackers)</li>
              <li>Their central position means they are in an ideal position to support both attackers and defender when required</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="column" style="background-color:#004700;">
            <h3>Attack (Forward)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Role is to score goals</li>
              <li>Player must be physically within the D in order to be able to score a goal</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Goalie</h3>
        <p>Although goalkeepers are technically part of the defence I thought it would be
           more appropriate to give them their own seperate category given that the way
           they play so diffferent to the other players and different rules apply to them.

                The curved side is called the backstick and is not allowed to touch the ball ever.</li>
